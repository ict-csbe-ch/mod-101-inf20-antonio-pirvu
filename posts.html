            <h1 class="md">Minecraft</h1>
            <p>
                Minecraft is a very fun game where you can freely express your creativity, either through creating zour character or building whatever you can imagine in your head. If zou are a less creative person, grinding to get materials and becoming the overlord of your world can be very fun as well.
                The game itself is a masterpiece just like the one before, though it does get a little bland at times.<br><br>
                The simplicity of the game is simply beautiful, modders who create content for the game make it even more enjoyable.
                <br><br>The game can be addictive as well, especially when plazing on minigame servers.

            <h1 class="md">Genshin Impact</h1>
            <p>
                What I like most about Genshin Impact are the character designs. You cannot create your own character, but you can earn them through a roulette function in the game if you are lucky.<br><br> Every character is unique and has its own personality, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Their magical abilities are very intriguing and they never cease to mesmerize me.<br><br>
                The game itself is a masterpiece, in my opinion, though it does resemble another game very closely: “Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild”.<br><br>
                The scenery, ambiance, various enemies, and dialogue of the game create a fantastical feeling that pull you further into the lore of it. <br><br>Some of those enemies are a bunch of different elemental bosses, each with their own weaknesses, which you must find and exploit. Usually, you would do that by attacking them with the opposite element they are made of, or hitting a certain spot (Fire against Ice, hitting the head usually does the most damage).<br><br>
                The game is truly addictive, as there is never a dull moment. Finding as much treasure and as many rewards as I possibly can hasn’t tired me yet either, especially when playing with friends.
                Having teammates help you with simple stuff around your world improves the experience a lot more as well, especially when fighting in dungeons together.

            <p>
                I like rocket league because it's simple, yet so fun to play. I like the way the cars are designed and the way you can customize them however you want. <br><br> There are a bunch of different stickers and flags you can add to your cars. However, there must be a reddish or orange car and a blue or greenish car since you'll always be playing in teams. So it's basically like soccer - but with cars. There are different types of game modes you can play, ranging from basic training to competitive playing that gets intense really quickly. It's a lot of fun when you play it with friends and try to get the ball all at once. <br><br>My favorite part about it is getting the chance to score a goal right at the beginning.
